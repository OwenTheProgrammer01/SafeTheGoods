# SafeTheGoods

I programmed and designed SafeTheGoods myself. This was for my Gameplay Scripting exam in 2023-2024 in my DAE course Game Development.

# Goal

The goal was to design your own little game. It had to be a small project thats fun to play.
Purely looking at the design aspect, so no beautiful look, etc.

# Warning

The code didn't need to be good, so its probably not the best but also not the worsed.

# Disclaimer

This project was fully made by myself. Its little but fun to play. This project was made for my study course.
